0.16  2005-09-05
  - added support for Firefox to Makefile.PL (copied from Gtk2::MozEmbed;
    untested, please report success or failure)
  - added no_index to META.yml to suppress indexing the examples on CPAN.
    Thanks to Adam Kennedy for pointing that out.

0.15  2005-09-04
  - moved POD from xs/DOM.xs into lib/Mozilla/DOM/*.pod. At the expense of
    the POD no longer being auto-generated, people can now read the POD
    without having to install the module (e.g. on CPAN), install time
    is slightly reduced, and I have better control over the POD output.
    (Still need to clean up the POD.)
    I also suppressed generating separate man pages because I don't see
    the point (you should delete any existing man/man3/Mozilla*.3pm files
    if you've installed this module before).
  - removed Glib dependency

0.14  2005-08-29
  - added most of WebNavigation, with an example WebNav.pm
  - require specifically enabling EventListener, using
    `perl Makefile.PL DEFINE="-DMDEXP_EVENT_LISTENER"`,
    after Torsten Schoenfeld reported that compiling Gtk2::MozEmbed
    was giving warnings (need help of a C++ expert)

0.13  2005-04-21
  - added browser object interfaces
    o  Navigator, History, Location, and Screen
    o  Window2 and WindowInternal, to get the browser objects
  - added the example BrowserObjects.pm
  - fixed the EventListener example

0.12  2005-04-20
  - keep in mind that Mozilla::DOM is alpha software, subject to change:
    o  added experimental EventListener support, with an example
       EventListeners.pm
    o deprecated all constants, although I didn't reimplement them
      correctly yet :/

0.11  2005-04-18
  - wrapped more interfaces (total is 88 now; there are >260 in Mozilla)
    o  54 HTML*Element classes
    o  HTMLCollection and HTMLOptionsCollection
  - added HTMLElements example
  - added the gendomxsubs.pl script which I use to generate XSUBs
    from Mozilla headers
  - fixed GetIID POD (but not yet the warnings during `make`)

0.10  2005-04-16
  - implemented Supports (QueryInterface method, plus GetIID class method
    for all interfaces), which means we can now create events!
  - added the Events example, showing mouse clicks and key presses
  - Uwe Voelker pointed me to the CPAN Forum. I registered to receive
    notification of posts, so you can post there if you want. See the
    'Contact' section of the README for details.

0.09  2005-04-11
  - added Elements example, demoing the tedium of DOM manipulation

0.08  2005-04-10
  - header includes - added two directories to set_inc in Makefile.PL:
    o  Torsten Schoenfeld noted that nsIWebBrowser.h is under the 'webbrwsr'
       directory on his system, so added that to the includes in Makefile.PL.
    o  another Gentoo user (Y. Selkowitz?) found that nsISelection.h was
       in the 'contents' directory
  - added Credits file

0.07  2005-04-10
  - wrapped methods for: MutationEvent, NamedNodeMap, Attr,
    ProcessingInstruction, CharacterData, Text, DocumentType,
    DOMImplementation, Selection, Range
  - made everything inherit from Supports, though QueryInterface still
    needs to be implemented
  - added some examples in 'examples' directory:
    o  Minilla - minimal Gtk2::MozEmbed
    o  Signals - demo signals in Gtk2::MozEmbed
  - changed several doctypes to something more comprehensible

0.06  2005-04-08
  - switched method names to StudlyCaps style instead of under_score,
    because it was too tedious when reading/creating documentation
    and XSUBs; provided aliases for KeyEvent, MouseEvent, and WebBrowser)
    Otherwise, they should be considered deprecated (not that anyone is
    actually using this module yet).
  - wrapped methods:
    o  Element: GetTagName, GetAttribute, GetElementsByTagName, ...
    o  Node: GetNode(Name|Value|Type), GetChildNodes, InsertBefore, ...
    o  NodeList: GetLength, Item
    With these, you're now able to insert elements (e.g. text)
    into the document (e.g. from within Gtk2::MozEmbed's new_window
    signal handler).
  - fixed Document::GetImplementation args

0.05  2005-04-07
  - made typemaps for nsAString args (nsEmbedString),
    which simplifies making XSUBs
  - wrapped methods:
    o  Document: get_element_by_id/tag_name, create_element, ...
    o  EventTarget: add_event_listener, remove_event_listener,
       dispatch_event
    o  Window: get_document, get_frames, get_parent, get_top (not done)
    o  WindowCollection: get_length, item, named_item

0.04  2005-04-06
  - added support for creating events
    o  wrapped the DocumentEvent class, namely its create_event method
    o  added MutationEvent; still need to wrap methods
    o  wrapped Init* methods: init_event, init_uievent, init_mouseevent,
       init_keyevent, init_mutationevent
  - added 'types' constants to Node class
  - added WebBrowser
  - wrapped a couple Window methods: get_name, set_name, size_to_content

0.03  2005-04-05
  - added typemapping support so that gtk_moz_embed_get_nsIWebBrowser
    can be wrapped in Gtk2::MozEmbed, and thus nsIWebBrowser's
    GetContentDOMWindow method can be wrapped
  - wrapped the following nsIDOM* classes: UIEvent, AbstractView,
    DocumentView
  - copied documentation in place and added typemap conversions for:
    EventTarget, EventListener, Window, WindowCollection, Document,
    Node, NodeList, Element, EntityReference, Attr, ProcessingInstruction,
    CDATASection, Comment, CharacterData, Text, DocumentFragment,
    DocumentType, DOMImplementation

0.02  2005-04-03
  - changed mozilla-gtkmozembed dependency to mozilla-xpcom
    so that GtkMozEmbed is no longer required
  - finished event class methods except for the "Init*" methods
    o  added get_type and get_time_stamp to the Event class
    o  added get_related_target to the MouseEvent class
  - added `get_key_code' constants to the KeyEvent class

0.01  2005-04-02
  - initial release, with much help from Torsten Schoenfeld
    o  wrappings for nsIDOMKeyEvent and nsIDOMMouseEvent
