  - added Elements example, demoing the tedium of DOM manipulation

0.08  2005-04-10
  - header includes - added two directories to set_inc in Makefile.PL:
    o  Torsten Schoenfeld noted that nsIWebBrowser.h is under the 'webbrwsr'
       directory on his system, so added that to the includes in Makefile.PL.
    o  another Gentoo user (Y. Selkowitz?) found that nsISelection.h was
       in the 'contents' directory
  - added Credits file

0.07  2005-04-10
  - wrapped methods for: MutationEvent, NamedNodeMap, Attr,
    ProcessingInstruction, CharacterData, Text, DocumentType,
    DOMImplementation, Selection, Range
  - made everything inherit from Supports, though QueryInterface still
    needs to be implemented
  - added some examples in 'examples' directory:
    o  Minilla - minimal Gtk2::MozEmbed
    o  Signals - demo signals in Gtk2::MozEmbed
  - changed several doctypes to something more comprehensible

0.06  2005-04-08
  - switched method names to StudlyCaps style instead of under_score,
    because it was too tedious when reading/creating documentation
    and XSUBs; provided aliases for KeyEvent, MouseEvent, and WebBrowser
    because Torsten doesn't like StudlyCaps :) Otherwise, they should
    be considered deprecated (not that anyone is actually using this
    module yet).
  - wrapped methods:
    o  Element: GetTagName, GetAttribute, GetElementsByTagName, ...
    o  Node: GetNode(Name|Value|Type), GetChildNodes, InsertBefore, ...
    o  NodeList: GetLength, Item
    With these, you're now able to insert elements (e.g. text)
    into the document (e.g. from within Gtk2::MozEmbed's new_window
    signal handler).
  - fixed Document::GetImplementation args

0.05  2005-04-07
  - made typemaps for nsAString args (nsEmbedString),
    which simplifies making XSUBs
  - wrapped methods:
    o  Document: get_element_by_id/tag_name, create_element, ...
    o  EventTarget: add_event_listener, remove_event_listener,
       dispatch_event
    o  Window: get_document, get_frames, get_parent, get_top (not done)
    o  WindowCollection: get_length, item, named_item

0.04  2005-04-06
  - added support for creating events
    o  wrapped the DocumentEvent class, namely its create_event method
    o  added MutationEvent; still need to wrap methods
    o  wrapped Init* methods: init_event, init_uievent, init_mouseevent,
       init_keyevent, init_mutationevent
  - added 'types' constants to Node class
  - added WebBrowser; not sure if that will stay in Mozilla::DOM
    or be in Gtk2::MozEmbed
  - wrapped a couple Window methods: get_name, set_name, size_to_content

0.03  2005-04-05
  - added typemapping support so that gtk_moz_embed_get_nsIWebBrowser
    can be wrapped in Gtk2::MozEmbed, and thus nsIWebBrowser's
    GetContentDOMWindow method can be wrapped
  - wrapped the following nsIDOM* classes: UIEvent, AbstractView,
    DocumentView
  - copied documentation in place and added typemap conversions for:
    EventTarget, EventListener, Window, WindowCollection, Document,
    Node, NodeList, Element, EntityReference, Attr, ProcessingInstruction,
    CDATASection, Comment, CharacterData, Text, DocumentFragment,
    DocumentType, DOMImplementation

0.02  2005-04-03
  - changed mozilla-gtkmozembed dependency to mozilla-xpcom
    so that GtkMozEmbed is no longer required
  - finished event class methods except for the "Init*" methods
    o  added get_type and get_time_stamp to the Event class
    o  added get_related_target to the MouseEvent class
  - added `get_key_code' constants to the KeyEvent class

0.01  2005-04-02
  - initial release, with much help from Torsten Schoenfeld
    o  wrappings for nsIDOMKeyEvent and nsIDOMMouseEvent
