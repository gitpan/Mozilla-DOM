  - added typemapping support so that gtk_moz_embed_get_nsIWebBrowser
    can be wrapped in Gtk2::MozEmbed, and thus nsIWebBrowser's
    GetContentDOMWindow method can be wrapped
  - wrapped the following nsIDOM* classes: UIEvent, AbstractView,
    DocumentView
  - copied documentation in place and added typemap conversions for:
    EventTarget, EventListener, Window, WindowCollection, Document,
    Node, NodeList, Element, EntityReference, Attr, ProcessingInstruction,
    CDATASection, Comment, CharacterData, Text, DocumentFragment,
    DocumentType, DOMImplementation
