  - added support for creating events
    o  wrapped the DocumentEvent class, namely its create_event method
    o  added MutationEvent; still need to wrap methods
    o  wrapped Init* methods: init_event, init_uievent, init_mouseevent,
       init_keyevent, init_mutationevent
  - added 'types' constants to Node class,
  - added WebBrowser; not sure if that will stay in Mozilla::DOM
    or be in Gtk2::MozEmbed
  - wrapped a couple Window methods: get_name, set_name, size_to_content

  - added typemapping support so that gtk_moz_embed_get_nsIWebBrowser
    can be wrapped in Gtk2::MozEmbed, and thus nsIWebBrowser's
    GetContentDOMWindow method can be wrapped
  - wrapped the following nsIDOM* classes: UIEvent, AbstractView,
    DocumentView
  - copied documentation in place and added typemap conversions for:
    EventTarget, EventListener, Window, WindowCollection, Document,
    Node, NodeList, Element, EntityReference, Attr, ProcessingInstruction,
    CDATASection, Comment, CharacterData, Text, DocumentFragment,
    DocumentType, DOMImplementation

    o  added get_related_target to the MouseEvent class
