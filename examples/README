This directory contains examples of using Mozilla::DOM
with Gtk2::MozEmbed. You need to have installed Gtk2::MozEmbed
after installing Mozilla::DOM so that Gtk2::MozEmbed would have
linked to code in Mozilla::DOM.

The examples are all started with `startapp.pl'. This uses
one of the modules in the current directory, such as Minilla.pm.
You start a particular example by passing the module name as
a command-line argument. For example,

  ./startapp.pl Minilla.pm

(The .pm suffix is optional.)

A description of the examples follows. I recommend looking at
them in order.

Minilla: Minimal example of using Gtk2::MozEmbed

Signals: All the signals in Gtk2::MozEmbed

Elements: DOM manipulation, e.g. inserting text and changing attributes

Events: Firing DOM events, such as mouse clicks

HTMLElements: demonstrates HTML*Element classes
