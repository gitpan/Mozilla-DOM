This directory contains examples of using Mozilla::DOM
with Gtk2::MozEmbed. You need to have installed Gtk2::MozEmbed
after installing Mozilla::DOM so that Gtk2::MozEmbed would have
linked to code in Mozilla::DOM.

The examples are all started with `startapp.pl'. This uses
one of the modules in the current directory, such as Minilla.pm.
You start a particular example by passing the module name as
a command-line argument. For example,

  ./startapp.pl Minilla.pm

(The .pm suffix is optional.)

A brief description of the examples follows. I recommend looking
at them in order.

Minilla: minimal example of using Gtk2::MozEmbed

Signals: all the signals in Gtk2::MozEmbed

Elements: DOM manipulation, e.g. inserting text and changing attributes

Scroll: shows some Scroll* window methods

Events: firing DOM events, such as mouse clicks

HTMLElements: demonstrates HTML*Element classes

EventListeners: add DOM event handlers, but in Perl instead of JavaScript

BrowserObjects: shows Navigator, History, Location (and Screen)

WebNav: shows WebNavigator, which is similar to the browser objects

Range: set range boundaries, select nodes

InnerHTML: print out HTML nodes as text
