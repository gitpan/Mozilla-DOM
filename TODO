Future plans include wrapping more DOM interfaces such as nsIWebBrowser
(requiring support in Gtk2::MozEmbed for gtk_moz_embed_get_nsIWebBrowser),
nsIDOMWindow, and nsIDOMDocument. With this, you'd get access to the DOM,
with methods such as GetElementsByTagName. Adding more support for DOM
events would allow finding out more about an event and its targets,
initiating events, and adding listeners. Then you could presumably
script a browser from Perl.

Add tests somehow...

Document how to add this to a module using ExtUtils::Depends.

Split DOM.xs into separate files.

Create aliases for the StudlyCaps names of methods? In retrospect,
I'm not sure if I like that the names were changed, as it makes
reading (and creating!) documentation more difficult.

Figure out EventListener and EventTarget.

Figure out how to typemap nsAString.
