Remove POD from XS file so that it's not auto-generated
and to remove Glib.pm dependence. Split DOM.xs into
separate files. (DOM.xs = 6300 lines at last count)
Work out how to export constants from various packages.

Make some methods more perlish. For example,
GetElementsByTagName returns a NodeList,
but it would be nicer if it was a list of Nodes
in list context. Also, some method arguments
could be made optional.

Figure out EventListener, EventTarget, DOMException.

Find reference of different interfaces for each class
(DocumentEvent for Document, etc.), what interfaces are
valid to switch to with QueryInterface.

Wrap nsIDOMHTML*Element interfaces
Mozilla::Mechanize

Document how to add this to a module using ExtUtils::Depends.

Add more examples.

Tests....
