Add Firefox support in Makefile.PL like Gtk2::MozEmbed does.

Remove POD from XS file so that it's not auto-generated
and to remove Glib.pm dependence. Split DOM.xs into
separate files. (DOM.xs > 19000 lines at last count)
Work out how to export constants from various packages.

Make some methods more perlish. For example,
GetElementsByTagName returns a NodeList,
but it would be nicer if it was a list of Nodes
in list context. Also, some method arguments
could be made optional.

Figure out EventListener, EventTarget, DOMException.
(I'm not sure if DOMException is even relevant from C++.)
Continue wrapping interfaces like a maniac.

Find a reference for different interfaces of each class
(DocumentEvent for Document, etc.), what interfaces are
valid to switch to with QueryInterface.

Mozilla::Mechanize

Add more examples.
Fill out missing documentation.
Document how to add this to a module using ExtUtils::Depends.
