Future plans include wrapping more DOM interfaces such as nsIWebBrowser
(requiring support in Gtk2::MozEmbed for gtk_moz_embed_get_nsIWebBrowser),
nsIDOMWindow, and nsIDOMDocument. With this, you'd get access to the DOM,
with methods such as GetElementsByTagName. Adding more support for DOM
events would allow finding out more about an event and its targets,
initiating events, and adding listeners.

Add tests somehow...
